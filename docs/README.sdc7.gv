The sdc7.gv file is a graphvis source file. You can run something like:

   dot -Tpng sdc7.gv > sdc7.gv.png

to generate a png file from this source file. Feel free to add better formatting
options to this file if you figure them out.

Also note that I've not yet represented the calls from workflow jobs to other
APIs here.
